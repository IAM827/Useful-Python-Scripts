In This Repo, You'll find a list of [32] Useful Python scripts generated with Artificial Intelligence.

They're categorized in the structure below. Scripts will be added gradually. The email organizer scripts require you to register an app in Azure AD and assign the necessary permissions to allow them to perform Microsoft Graph Explorer API calls. Some scripts will require additional python libraries to be installed for them to function.

Below are the required Python library files you'll need (I'll still include them at the end of the necessary scripts - in case you don't need them all).
